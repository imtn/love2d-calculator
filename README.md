# love2d-calculator

Can add, subtract, multiply, divide.
Divide by 0 to get inf. Multiply inf by 0 to get nan. This has something to do with C. I'm leaving it like that because it behaves the way I want it to - once you get inf or nan, can't do anything else with it unless you clear.
Works with numpad and the numbers on the top row of your keyboard.
